Working with a new language can always be very challenging especially the one that you're not very familiar with, kotlin happens to be one of those languages. Over the span of two weeks, I have made good progress learning and understanding the language. Kotlin is a cross platform programming language. it is designed to interoperate fully with Java add JVM version of kotlin. Of course, kotlin is just a language add we need an IDE to write, understand visually and compile code in Kotlin. having said that I made use of Android studio as my integrated development environment. 

The start of my project you could imagine was very hard and confusing, but because of my previous knowledge in Java, C sharp and especially html and CSS I was able to quickly understand how Android studio and kotlin worked. we were giving a project to create our first Android application. The application is intended to tell the user more about ourselves. Things like skills, accomplishments, hobbies etc. 

In my project, I went for a black and purple theme for the whole of the program. I made these decisions because black and purple are sharp colors. More specifically I use purple on the button, I chose this because purple powerful comes off sharply in a black background. For the most part of the program, I made use of linear layouts. This helped me construct my application in a specific manner(vertically). 

It wasn't all rainbows and sunshine though; I ran into a few problems when writing my application. Things like importing pictures and arranging them in a vertically organized linear layout was challenging till I cleared doubts in class.I also had a problem creating the apk file. It was created but for some reason it was not able to open. The apk file I created is located in a debug folder in my GitHub repo. As a result of this I was not able to show the apk file downloading in my screen recording. I made effort to resolve the issue. I consulted some material provided to me by the school and watched YouTube videos. Unfortunately, I was not able to resolve the issue. That being said, we can still see my application work as it should.  Kotlin is a new language for me I found myself forgetting basic codes like moving from one activity to the other. I cleared all doubts after watching a video on YouTube (link below)

I also had to do research on creating an apk file. I wasn't very sure exactly how to complete that task but I cleared all doubts after watching a YouTube video l(ink below)

At the end of the day, creating my Android application was not as difficult as I sort it out to be at first. Although, my application might come off as quite simple and simplified but quite some effort was put into creating the android application. I believe we more practices, I will be able to create a more organized and detailed android application that will come across and sophisticated and modern.
